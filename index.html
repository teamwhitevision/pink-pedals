                                <strong>Simple, convenient & Economical </strong>
Met my friends this Sunday for casual cycling and catching up. <br>Was pleasantly surprised on the ease with which, we could hire a bike
 and pedal on the famed JLN Marg with<br> WTP in the background. Loved the transparent billing system and the quality of accessories.<br>
 Drove for around an hour. All of us are convinced to meet ever so often now,<br>
  as no hastle of getting our own bikes or maintenance or even planning a better location
   than jawahar circle.<br> Thank you Pink Pedals. Keep it up.

                            <p>Today me and my friend took a ride over the bicycle. What we were attracted was the TANDEM BICYCLE which<br>
                                 we generally see in movies. It was fun riding the bicycle. It was something very new.<br>
                                  We enjoyed a lot! Even the prices were very much appropriate.<br> Pink pedals is no doubt a very good StartUp.</p>

I went to jawahar circle this sunday with my friends and rented cycles from Pink pedals.<br>
They provided all international brand geared cycles and for the safety they gave free helmets.<br>
 Their cycles had baskets to keep our hand stuff. Amzing service.<br>
  Had a great morning amidst the nature around us..

                    other illnesses. To keep this devil in check, cycle every day! Cycling curbs diabetes as it
                    uses up the glucose and converts it into useful energy. In Finland, a large scale research
                    found that risk of developing diabetes can be reduced to 40 per cent if a person cycles for
                    more than 30 minutes per day</p>

                    living the sedentary life, people who cycle regularly tend to have an enhanced
                    cardiovascular system.Regular cycling stimulates and improves your heart, lungs and
                    circulation, reducing your risk of cardiovascular diseases. Cycling strengthens your heart
                    muscles, lowers resting pulse and reduces blood fat levels.

                    to diseases like cancer. On the other hand, the risk of cancer did not decrease in sedentary
                    people. Many researchers have studied the relationship between exercise and cancer,
                    especially colon and breast cancer. Research has shown that if you cycle, the chance of

                                    <li>
                                    Cycle sharing is expected to boost the use of public transport by providing crucial last-mile
Connectivity, thereby expanding the catchment areas for the region’s rapid transit systems. It is offering the convenience of cycling without the burden of ownership and the flexibility to accommodate one-way trips. By encouraging a shift to sustainable modes, the cycle sharing system will reduce dependency on automobiles, particularly for short trips in the MWC, reduces traffic congestion, vehicle emissions, and demand for motor vehicle parking. Besides, the system will expand the health and wellness benefits of bicycle transport to new users.

                                        <li> Beginning of a sustainable future starts with one pedal push. We at Pink Pedals
                                            Jaipur were delighted enough to launch “Public Bicycle Sharing” in Mahindra World
                                            city, a future-focused, sustainable industrial ecosystems, thoughtfully designed to
                                            create a balance between Livelihood, Living and Life. Mahindra World City is India’s
                                            biggest integrated City spreading over 3000 Acres. </li>
        
                                        <li>Launched on 19-Mar-2019, Pink Pedals is covering its Multi-Product Economic Zone
                                            (SEZ) spread across 1500 acres with future plan of covering Domestic Tariff Area
                                            (DTA) spread across 1000 acres, in combination with planned co-located social
                                            infrastructure. The Vision of this project is to include the entire area in MWC with
                                            this sustainable mode of transport.

                                        <li>
                                            Cycle sharing is expected to boost the use of public transport by providing crucial
                                            last-mile
                                            Connectivity, thereby expanding the catchment areas for the region’s rapid transit
                                            systems. It is offering the convenience of cycling without the burden of ownership
                                            and the flexibility to accommodate one-way trips. By encouraging a shift to
                                            sustainable modes, the cycle sharing system will reduce dependency on automobiles,
                                            particularly for short trips in the MWC, reduces traffic congestion, vehicle
                                            emissions, and demand for motor vehicle parking. Besides, the system will expand the
                                            health and wellness benefits of bicycle transport to new users.
